<h1 class="about">About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Christina Rajaram, and I am a 19 year old Web Developer. I was born in Brooklyn, New York but spent the rest of my childhood in Kissimme, Florida. I have always found coding very interesting when I was younger, but I am not a very great self teacher so i decided not to go ahead with it. Until, one day I was doing some research about coding classes and stumbled across the UCF Coding Bootcamp and I told myself why not give it a shot. I have been more than happy with my choice ever since!</p>

    <p>Besides coding, I do take interest in some other hobbies. I love to find new baking recipes and make them on the weekends for my family,  just to sweeten them up a little bit. When you don't see me with a computer in my face, you'll most likely see a book in its place, particularly Fantasy Literature.</p>
